# SMB (Server Message Block): Port Number -- 139,445
SMB SMB (Server Message Block) is one of the most important port and this protocol is designed to share files. In SMB, authentication is required to access resources or files. Basically SMB runs on default port number 139 or 445. Strong password should be used by the admin on their important resources so that it cannot be easily guessable. 
SMB has been used primarily to connect Windows computers, although most other systems -- such as Linux and macOS -- also include client components for connecting to SMB resources.
